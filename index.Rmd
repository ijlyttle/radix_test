```

This site works properly, however, if you try to insert a menu item without an `href`, like so:

```
navbar:
  right:
    - text: "Home"
      href: index.html
    - text: "About"
      href: about.html
      menu: 
      - text: "header"
      - text: "Thing 1"
        href: index.html
      - text: "Thing 2"
        href: index.html
```

Then the html does not show up properly in the RStudio Preview window, nor at Github pages. However, it does show up locally if I open using a browser.

If I open the JavaScript console from the RStudio Preview window, it gives me this error:

```
